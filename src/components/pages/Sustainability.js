                                    The world is getting faster & chaotic, and so are the industries. The fashion industry is unfortunately one of those that have lost its sustainability and ethical values. As these values are very important, we want the sustainable fashion to grow and therefor we spread awareness of these core problems - which can be fixed.

                                    We are on a journey to help eliminate the chaos in the world - by giving the shoes from forgotten shops and facililties a new life.

                                <p>It is an approach which guards the whole process. In an ideal world, everybody would do their best to maximize the benefits to the industry and society, and at the same time, minimize the impact on the environment and humanity.

                                    And that is exactly what society should aim for.

                                <p>Ethical means morally right and acceptable. Therefore, ethical and sustainable fashion does not start from manufacturing clothes. It starts from the cotton fields and ends in consumer's wardrobe.</p>
